# Mean and variance as moments of a distribution .................................................... 

# Simulate a probability distribution (example with outcomes and probabilities)
# Suppose we have a random variable X with possible values and their probabilities:
values <- c(2, 4, 5, 7, 9) # Possible outcomes
probabilities <- c(0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2) # Corresponding probabilities (must sum to 1)

# Mean as first moment of the distribution
mean_distribution <- sum(values * probabilities)
cat("\nMean as first moment of the distribution:", mean_distribution, "\n")

# Variance as second moment of the distribution
variance_distribution <- sum((values - mean_distribution)^2 * probabilities)
cat("Variance as second moment of the distribution:", variance_distribution, "\n")
